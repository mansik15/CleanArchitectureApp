#The CleanArchitecture App
##Overview
> Clean architecture divides your app into three primary layers:
- Presentation Layer: Handles UI logic (Activities, Fragments, ViewModels).
- Domain Layer: Contains business rules and use cases, independent of frameworks.
- Data Layer: Responsible for data access (repositories, data sources, network calls).
