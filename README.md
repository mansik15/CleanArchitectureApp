# The CleanArchitecture App<br>
## Overview
### I made a basic country listing app which follows clean architecture. It divides app into three primary layers:
- Presentation Layer: Handles UI logic (Activities, Fragments, ViewModels).
- Domain Layer: Contains business rules and use cases, independent of frameworks.
- Data Layer: Responsible for data access (repositories, data sources, network calls).
