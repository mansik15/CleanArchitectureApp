# The CleanArchitecture App<br>
## Overview
### I made a basic country listing app which follows clean architecture. It divides app into three primary layers:
- Presentation Layer: Handles UI logic (Activities, Fragments, ViewModels).
- Domain Layer: Contains business rules and use cases, independent of frameworks.
- Data Layer: Responsible for data access (repositories, data sources, network calls).

  In the domain layer, I have created a use case to get only countries names from whole API response coming from here(https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/1134062/T1LJjU52#dd5bd0d9-2602-4161-8c77-3af30cd2f41a)
